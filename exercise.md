# CSS Final Exercise ðŸš€

Your task is to make the CSS for this website. It consists of three pages that each need to be styled by you.

- Make the Laptop emoji bigger (!)

- Give the table of the laptop specs a nice styling (background-color is alternating between the rows, more spacing between the entries)
- Make the "buy laptop here" link look like a fancy button
- Add a hover effect to your links

- Create a contact form on one of your three pages

- Make everything responsive â€¼! nav footer pictures and text

#Done:

- Tidy up the image gallery by placing three images next to each other (3x3). You can use grid or flexbox ðŸ’ª (did weird with ul li, find easier way to do it)
- Make the images responsive for smaller screens (not a 3x3 placement anymore)
- Give all of the images a reasonable size
- Style the footer (remove the dot and center it)
- Choose a nice font for your webpage
- Add your name to the h2 on the homepage to show the world your styling skills
- Make the Navigation pretty and in one line.
- The Laptop emoji in the nav bar is supposed to be the icon of the website.
  Place it in the same line as the other elements from the navbar, but on the right side.
- Make the navbar fixed to the top of the page.
- Remove the dots from the unordered list in the navbar

Hint: You can of course modify the HTML by adding classes to your HTML tags, or by adding a `div` around certain elements
